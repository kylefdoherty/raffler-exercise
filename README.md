We start with a raffler that has all code in `$(document).ready()`, refactoring and adding features from the wrong to 'right-ish' way.

## Before the Lecture
- Bundle this repo successfully 

## Session 1 
- Run the app. Look at all that 'glorious' code in `$(document).ready()`
- Delete all the code
- Implement the seeding of the data through the embedded JSON in the dom
- Implement the abilty to pick a winner

## Session 2

- Separate the seeding of rows from the App 
- Separate the event handling function from the event 

## Session 3 
- Let's do stateful rendering with handlebars.
- You can only get lucky once
- What if we have a second celebrity to raffle? Make our Raffler object instantiable

## Session 4 
- Introducing CoffeeScript
- Let's rewrite our code in CS
- Useful features of CS 


## Session 5 
- Let's persist the winners. Closures and AJAX requests
- To be continued...
